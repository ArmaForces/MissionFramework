**ArmaForces - Mission Framework** is a collaborative effort of ArmaForces members (started by Madin) to enhance Arma 3 mission making process through adding modules for easier AI spawning and caching during missions.

The mod is on the same foundation as the ACE3 mod, using its framework, systems, tools and standards. It is entirely **open-source** and licensed under the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/ArmaForces/MadinAI/blob/master/LICENSE)).

Huge appreciation and thanks to [ACE3 Team](http://ace3mod.com/team.html) for their open-source nature and permission to use their systems.
